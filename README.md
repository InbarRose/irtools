## Note about code included or copied from external sources

Throughout the years I have compiled this set of utilities, most of it is written by me (Inbar) But some of it is copied from other sources, everywhere I have copied code I have included a link to the source, and where possible the type of license or a note about the author. If you believe I have made an error, or something I have included is wrong or needs updating, please let me know. It is not my intention to steal or cheat or claim work as my own, and if you dispute my using of your code, I will happily remove it. In some cases I made slight modifications to code mostly for readability, but in some cases I made modifications to enhance capabilities. Again, if anyone has a problem with anything I have done, please let me know. Thanks.
