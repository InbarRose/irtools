# Contributing to irtools

### Hello you!

> First off, thank you for considering contributing to irtools. It's people like you that make irtools such a great tool.

### Before we get started

> Please take a moment to review this document in order to make the contribution process easy and effective for everyone involved.

> Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. (Remember, its currently maintained by just one man) In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

### How you can contribute

> Keep an open mind! Improving documentation, bug triaging, or writing tutorials and examples are all helpful contributions that are welcomed.

> irtools is an open source project and I would be happy to include your contributions, code or not.

> Just remember, please open an issue before any contributions or pull requests so we can properly discuss any contributions. I wouldn't want to waste anyone's time if it's something I do not plan on including in the project.

# Ground Rules

> Please follow the [irtools Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

> Please follow the [Python Community Code of Conduct](https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/).

# Your First Contribution
> If this is your first contribution, please read our [pull request template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) and make sure you open a Pull Request issue.

> Unsure where to begin contributing to irtools? You can start by adding examples of how you used irtools to the projects examples

### First time contributing to Open Source Project?:

> Here are a couple of friendly tutorials: http://makeapullrequest.com/ and http://www.firsttimersonly.com/

> Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this *free* series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

> At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone used to be a beginner at some point.

> If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.

# How to report a bug

> When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:
>
> 1. What version of irtools are you using (commit-id or version number or both)?
> 2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
> 3. What did you do?
> 4. What did you expect to see?
> 5. What did you see instead?

# How to suggest a feature or enhancement

### This is a project for DevOps and Automation

> The primary goal of this project is to provide a good collection of tools that can be used in DevOps and Automation. That is where all these tools original come from. My own personal needs.

> Handy and nifty tools are welcome too. Sometimes we have very specific needs, and a general tool does not supply them, so we create something handy, and sometimes we can extend that handy tool into something abstract enough to include in an open source project like this one.

### How does it work?

> You think of something you want in the project, some tool, utility, or kit. You open a feature request and we discuss it.

> When deciding if you should make a feature request, make sure to answer these three questions:
>
> 1. What is the scope of the feature?
> 2. Why is it needed?
> 3. How might it work?

> Then Open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.

# Code review process
### Pull Request Progress

> I have to review all pull requests, so it might take a while. Please be patient.
